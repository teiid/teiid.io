# teiid.io website

## Repo Structure

The teiid.io website repo contains 3 branches.


* **dev**
  * development branch used to stage the latest yet-to-be-released content
  * commits/merges will trigger a Netlify build (~ 5 minutes) that will generate and publish web content
  * view staging website at: https://teiiddev.netlify.com/
* **master**
  * contains the approved/latest site source code/markdown
  * when sufficient new content is added to **dev**, or critical fixes or additions are applied, a PR will be created and merged to the **master** branch.
  * 
* **gh-pages**
  * changes to the **master** branch will trigger a [.travis.yml](https://github.com/teiid/teiid.io/blob/master/.travis.yml)  build to generate content, merge to **gh-pages** and published to https://teiid.github.io/teiid.io/



## Get the code

The easiest way to get started with the code is to [create your own **fork**](http://help.github.com/forking/)
 of this repository, and then clone your fork:

```bash
  $ git clone git@github.com:<github-username>/teiid.io.git
  $ cd teiid.io
  $ git remote add upstream git@github.com:<github-username>/teiid.io.git
```

At any time, you can pull changes from the upstream and merge them onto your **dev**:

```bash
  $ git checkout dev       # switches to the 'dev' branch
  $ git pull upstream dev  # fetches all 'upstream' changes and merges 'upstream/dev' onto your 'dev' branch
  $ git push origin           # pushes all the updates to your fork, which should be in-sync with 'upstream'
```
