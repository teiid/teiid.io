<!--more-->

Teiid 12.2.0 continued the work of 12.1.0 to better isolate dependencies for usage as embedded or with Spring Boot.  

The feature highlights for 12.2 are:

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/TEIID-5619">TEIID-5619</a> Added system admin tables and procedures for sessions, requests, and transactions.</li>
  <li>Various refactorings to support lighter-weight embedded and Spring scenarios.  Including optional geospatial and xml/xpath libraries, and removal of several dependencies from the core.</li>
  <li><a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/TEIID-5500">TEIID-5500</a> Improved OData performance - especially with large results.</li>
</ul>

See all 51 issues in [JIRA] (https://issues.jboss.org/projects/TEIID/versions/12340672).  Special thanks go out to Dmitrii Pogorelov, Christoph John, and Mark Twak for reporting issues.

You can expect a fix release in 4-5 weeks, and 12.3.0 in 8-12 weeks.

Thank you, 
The Teiid Team
